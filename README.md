#Intro to CSS Grid

Creating the desired layout in CSS/HTML has always been difficult. HTML and CSS were originally designed to help make documents (think academic papers) look better. Ever since then, creative designers have constantly pushed the boundaries of the technology.

As more and more design came to depend on grid layouts over the years, developers created their own solutions to fill a major hole in the functionality of CSS: the grid. Homegrown grid solutions evolved and improved, and eventually became a tool that found its way into nearly every project. When third-party solutions become ubiquitous, the W3C takes notice and begins to formulate a way to move that functionality into native CSS. Luckily, they did that with the CSS Grid module, and that's what we'll be exploring today.
